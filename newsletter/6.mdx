## Features Updates üåü

### `NULLS {FIRST | LAST}`

[feat(common): support `NULLS {FIRST | LAST}` by richardchien ¬∑ Pull Request #8485](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/8485)

`NULL` s can be very tricky in SQL. Do you known you can specify its ordering?

```sql
> select * from t order by x /* nulls last */; 
+--------+
| x      |
|--------|
| 1      |
| 2      |
| <null> |
+--------+

> select * from t order by x nulls first;
+--------+
| x      |
|--------|
| <null> |
| 1      |
| 2      |
+--------+
```

It was tricky to support because previously in RisingWave, we only considered ascending/descending ordering, but not `NULL` s‚Äô ordering. That caused inconsistent `NULL` s ordering around the system. When it comes to SQL query results, the `NULL` values were sometimes the largest, sometimes the smallest.

This also blocked our progress to test RisingWave against other database‚Äôs test suites, because in PostgreSQL, `NULL` s are the largest by default when compared against non-NULL values, while in SQLite and DuckDB they are the smallest by default. With inconsistent ordering of `NULL` s and no support for `NULLS { FIRST | LAST }` in order-by clauses, we can neither align with the behavior of one of these databases, nor specify a fixed `NULL` ordering in test queries to align behaviors of all databases.

Recently, we did a thorough refactoring to force all components in our system to use an unified struct type representing ordering, `OrderType` . As a result, this week we were finally able to implement `NULLS { FIRST | LAST }` for order-by clauses at ease, by simply adding a new field, `NullsAre` , to `OrderType` , specifying whether `NULL` s are largest or smallest. By setting `Largest` as default value of `NullsAre` , we achieved the same default ordering behavior as PostgreSQL.

### Rename relations

[feat: support alter rename relations including table/mview/view/sink/index by yezizp2012 ¬∑ Pull Request #7745](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/7745)

As I [mentioned earlier](https://xxchan.github.io/this-week-in-risingwave/2023/02/25/twirw-2.html#table-schema-change), we are working on DDL support ( `ALTER TABLE` ), which is quite tricky. We've already done quite some work for supporting `ADD/DROP COLUMN` . Here's another DDL: renaming relations is supported. This might be slightly easier than `ADD/DROP COLUMN` , but there are still some tricky parts to consider carefully, like updating all related relations all at the same time.

For example, you can use the command `ALTER TABLE t_1 RENAME TO t_2` to rename a table and its related relations will be modified recursively, which you can check with command such as `SHOW CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_x` . There is no effect on the stored data.

## Performance Optimizations üí™

### Bushy tree join ordering

[feat: Bushy tree join ordering by KveinAxel ¬∑ Pull Request #8316](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/8316#pullrequestreview-1345479333)

RisingWave is a streaming processing system that aims to provide real-time low latency for our users. By reducing the depth of the join tree, we can effectively minimize latency.

See the illustration below:

To reduce the distance that barriers from join inputs need to travel to the join output, we convert a left-deep tree with a height of 3 into a bushy tree with a height of 5.

## Rusty stuff ü¶ÄÔ∏è

> [We ‚ù§Ô∏è Rust!](https://www.risingwave-labs.com/blog/building-a-cloud-database-from-scratch-why-we-moved-from-cpp-to-rust/) This section is about some general Rust related issues.

### zld

[Cannot run risingwave binary on Mac OS M1 (when linked by `zld` ) ¬∑ Issue #8608](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/issues/8608)

[@ahmedriza](https://github.com/ahmedriza) reported that he cannot run the binary on his Macbook M1 due to "symbol not found".

```
$ ./target/debug/risingwave
dyld[14116]: symbol not found in flat namespace (__ZN15protobuf_native2io23DeleteCodedOutputStreamEPN6google8protobuf2io17CodedOutputStreamE)
Abort trap: 6
```

After some investigation, he found that it's because he used `zld` in his global cargo config, and RisingWave has a repository-level cargo config that uses `lld`. Although it is still not clear whether the error is caused by `zld` or the conflict between the cargo configs, he could solve the problem by just using `lld`.

This is also one of the reasons why I enjoy open source: hackers are very willing to raise issues and even analyze and solve problems themselves. I can also learn a lot from their thoroughly analysis. From this issue, I learned:
- How [cargo config](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html) (`$HOME/.cargo/config.toml`, and `/projects/.cargo/config.toml`) works in more detail
- There's another linker `zld`. (But it's already deprecated in favor of `lld` .)

## New Contributors

(Of course, [@ahmedriza](https://github.com/ahmedriza) is also a great new contributor!)

[feat: Add support for array_length function in psql by kamalesh0406 ¬∑ Pull Request #8636](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/8636)

This week we have another first-time contributor [@kamalesh0406](https://github.com/kamalesh0406). He said "This is my first time writing rust code" üò≤.

So it seems RisingWave's [good first issue](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc)s are a good way to learn and practice Rust. üòÑ Don't hesitate and just join us if you are also interested in the development of an open source database system, or Rust!
